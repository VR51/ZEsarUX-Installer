# ZEsarUX Installer & Updater
ZEsarUX Installation script written in BASH

ZEsarUX is the best ZX Spectrum, Amstrad and SAM Emulator for Linux. The source files are available from [https://github.com/chernandezba/zesarux/](https://github.com/chernandezba/zesarux/).

Documentation for the machines emulated by ZEsarUX can be found [here](https://github.com/chernandezba/zesarux-extras/tree/master/extras)

ZEsarUX documentation is [here](https://github.com/chernandezba/zesarux/tree/master/src/docs)

This ZEsarUX Installer & Updater script downloads/clones the source files to HOME/src/zesarux then builds and installs the emulator complete with desktop application icon.

This script is written by me (Lee Hodson). ZEsarUX is developed by Cesar Hernandez Bano. The only relationship this script has with Cesar is that it installs Cesar's program.

## TO RUN

Download the file zesarux.sh

Ensure the script is executable.

`Right-click > properties > Executable`

OR

Launch the script by clicking the script file or by typing bash zesarux.sh at the command line.
